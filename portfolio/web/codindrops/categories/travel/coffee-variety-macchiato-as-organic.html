            that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
            to its own, safe country.

        <p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed
            her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their
            projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind
            the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
